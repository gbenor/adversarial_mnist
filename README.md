# MNIST Adversarial Attack Evaluation

## Overview

This project is dedicated to evaluating various adversarial attacks against an MNIST classifier. It aims to assess the robustness of the classifier by exposing it to a range of adversarial attack techniques, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms.

## Features

- Comprehensive evaluation of different adversarial attack methods.
- Detailed analysis of the MNIST classifier's response to these attacks.
- Statistical and visual tools for understanding attack impacts.
